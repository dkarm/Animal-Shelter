# Animal-Shelter

This is an attempt to classify the animal shelter data from kaggle and predict which animals will be adopted, euthanised, transferred based on charactersitics such as gender, type of dog/cat, type of animal, age of stay at the shelter, time of year/day, breed.

In order to do this, I do some feature engineering to create more interesting features for the animals and then try a variety of classifiers to correctly predict their class.
